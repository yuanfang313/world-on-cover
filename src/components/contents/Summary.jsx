            When I started to think about my perspective of this project, I asked myself a strange question: <em className="ja2">what
            would it be like if a person just lives in “a world on the cover”</em> ? The answer might be: the person will never know he or she lives “on the cover” and will never fully understand this world. Somehow, it is also true for ourselves.
        </p>
        <p className="th2_text container">
        Although “the world” on the cover of <em>Sanlian Lifeweek</em> is just a tiny fragment of the reflection of our “real world,” one way to approach our own reality might be to find the “fragments” like this and piece them together.
